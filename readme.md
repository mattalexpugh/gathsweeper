# Gathsweeper

I've been a bit obsessed with Minesweeper lately, and wanted to have it in my tmux sessions. I don't really know why. Anyway, it's implemented in Python 3.6.

I'll include a switch for the text/curses input later, for now:

```bash
python gathsweeper.py -r num_rows -c num_cols -m num_mines
```
